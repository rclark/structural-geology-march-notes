# time
- how do we represent cross-cutting relationships?
- how to indicate multiple times that are apparent in the outcrop?
- how to represent a chain of events?
- events are observed through different scales and techniques
- use relation between attributes and allow labeling of features

#tectonics
- constraints on 
    - setting: back arc basin / thrust belt
    - timing: ordivician, post 100-pre 95m, sevier?
    - process: mineral growth, fault movement, fault reactivation (considerable disagreement)
