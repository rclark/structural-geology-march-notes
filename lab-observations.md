# Observations on samples
- Geographic location

## tensor qualities: Inferences from the others
- infinitesimal strain
- finite strain
- stress
- AMS: anisotropy of magnetic susceptability

## thin section
- rock type
- shear sense
- mineralogy
- deformed markers
- lattice preferred orientation
- shape preferred orientation
- grain size
- grain size distribution
- grain boundary orientation
- microstructures (a very loaded one)
- cross-cutting relationships
- 3d shapes of rock components
- melt distributions
- images
- section's absolute orientation
- *Link to geochemistry/geochronology* (WDS, Isotopic, etc.)
- *Link to P-T-t conditions*

## slabs (same as thin section, except no LPO)

## physical properties
- density
- permeability
- porosity

# Use-cases (or example query criteria)
- experimentalist has a particular microstructure, have you seen anything like it in nature?
- stuctural geologist in area another structural geologist has worked on. what did they see?
- you're interested in shear zones, want to see where there are shear zones in granite containing more than 5% biotite
- find shear zones with some known amount of finite strain, in granites with 5% biotite
- start working in some mountain range, find any available information
- once you've found any available information, sort it through time
- looking for pseudotachylite in association with fractures, or with mylonites
- see a bunch of pictures of mylonite that have been produced in a specific rock type
- fault zones with aggregate clasts in them
- find any cross-sections from a particular area, see the surface traces, click to view the section
- find scm scale microstructures in shale
- find data reporting permeability + grain-size, or permeability + modal mineralogy
- generating "encyclopedia" of rheology based on observations of boudinage under certain pressure temperature conditions
- find publications that satisfy certain criteria *linked*
- find all data within some distance of me. view that data on a map, on a tablet 
- collect multiple structural measurements at a single place
- visualize a set of observations in a stereonet
